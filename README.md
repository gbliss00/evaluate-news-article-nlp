## Udacity 2020: Evaluate a news article with Natural Language Processing

## Overview

This app is a web tool that allows users to run Natural Language Processing (NLP) on articles or blogs found on other websites, using an api called Aylien.

Node and express will be used for the webserver and routing, and webpack is the build tool of choice. The app has dev and prod environments, each with their own set of tools and commands.

### To Run Project

**(Currently, prod mode allows you to see the results of the API fetch)**:
- cd into your new folder and run in prod mode 
- `npm install`
- `npm run build-prod to generate a dist folder for prod`
- `npm run start to run the Express server on port 8082`

**Note:** The web page can be accessed with `localhost:8082`
